   		House Targaryen is a noble family of Valyrian descent, and is the only family of dragonlords who survived the Doom of Valyria. They left Valyria twelve years before the Doom occurred and resided for more than a century on the island of Dragonstone.
   		<br/>
   		<br/>
   		House Targaryen ruled as the kings on the Iron Throne and as the Great House of the crownlands for nearly three hundred years. A total of thirteen Targaryens kings sat on the Iron Throne, until the reign of Aerys II Targaryen ended with Robert's Rebellion, in which the Targaryens were overthrown. The two surviving children of Aerys II, Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen, fled into exile, and have resided in Essos ever since.
   		<br/>
   		<br/>
   		House Targaryen took possession of the castle Dragonstone upon leaving Valyria. Following the Conquest, they built the Aegonfort in the capital city of King's Landing. The Aegonfort was later torn down and replaced by the Red Keep, which remained their main seat for the duration of their dynasty, and which housed the Iron Throne. Dragonstone almost always given to the heir to the throne.
   		<br/>
   		<br/>
   		House Targaryen historically followed the gods of Valyria. Sometime before Aegon's Conquest, the Targaryens abandoned the Valyrian gods and converted to the Faith of the Seven, the predominant religion in Westeros. However, they continued to follow the Valyrian practice of incestuous marriage, wedding brother to sister, cousin to cousin, uncle to niece and aunt to nephew, holding themselves apart from and above the noble Westerosi families.

   		As one of the forty dragonlord families of Valyria, the Targaryens were closer to dragons than other men. Aenar Targaryen brought five dragons with him when he moved from Valyria to Dragonstone, and Aegon I Targaryen and his sister-wives, Rhaenys and Visenya rode them to battle during the Conquest of the Seven Kingdoms in 2 BC - 1 BC. The Targaryens rode their dragons during the first century and a half following Aegon's Conquest.
